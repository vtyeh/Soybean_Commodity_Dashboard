# Soybean_Commodity_Dashboard
With a small team of 4, we created a website for different dashboard visualizations using plotly.js and echarts. For our database we used MongoDB and mLab to combine several different data sources. The purpose of this website is to give the user an easy way to explore historical data about soybeans as a commodity and to aid them in analyzing whether to buy soybean stock.
